# MAGD-150
# GitHub project
These are drawings that were done for my MAGD 150 course. Each file follows a theme such as _"space scene"_ or _"cityscape"_. The goal of the assignemnts were to make a scene according to the theme and perameters in order to make your own **unique** image. I did have some creative freedom as long as I was fulfilling all of the required elements of the coding language I had learned that week.
